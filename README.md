# zig-dockerfile
This repo provides docker image examples that contain zig.
These docker images can be used for the purpose of creating a [Docker container github action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action) or testing.

If you just want to use zig for building a github action and want to waive javascript completely this image might be for **YOU** ðŸ«µ!

> [!NOTE]
> The `Dockerfile` in the [main/default](https://github.com/42LM/zig-dockerfile) branch lets
> you build a regular version on `linux x86_64`.
>
> For more options check out different branches:
>
> Build a regular version with setting the `OS` and `ARCH`?
> - Check out the [default_os_arch](https://github.com/42LM/zig-dockerfile/tree/default_os_arch) branch.
>
> Build master/dev on `linux x85_64`?
> - Check out the [dev](https://github.com/42LM/zig-dockerfile/tree/dev) branch.
>
> Build master/dev version with setting the `OS` and `ARCH`?
> - Check out the [dev_os_arch](https://github.com/42LM/zig-dockerfile/tree/dev_os_arch) branch.

## Notes
This docker image fills a tiny niche and only exists for testing purposes and github actions.

> [!CAUTION]
> > [**Zig makes Docker irrelevant.**](https://github.com/ziglang/docker-zig) You probably do not need a Docker image to
build your Zig application, ...
